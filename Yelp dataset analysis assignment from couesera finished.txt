Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet 
 
This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary. 
 
In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required. 
 
For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately. 
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer. 
 
 
 
Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding 
 
1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below: 
  
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
  
 
 
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key. 
 
i. Business = 10000 
ii. Hours = 1562 
iii. Category = 2643 
iv. Attribute = 1115 
v. Review = 10000 
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 10000 
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id) 
ix. User = 10000 
x. Friend = 11  
xi. Elite_years = 2780 
 
Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	 
 
 
 
3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no." 
 
Answer:  no.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? 
 
Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
 
No,You can see that 609 review count has larger amount of fans than review count 968, 1153 and 2000 respectively. And that's not correlate each other with just review_count & fans. I think it should consider the new factors.
 
SELECT review_count , fans
FROM user 
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10;
+--------------+------+
| review_count | fans |
+--------------+------+
|          609 |  503 |
|          968 |  497 |
|         1153 |  311 |

Yes, they have different number of reviews of two groups at 'Las Vegas' City  as you can see from SUM(review_count) column 

SELECT CASE
     WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3'
     WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5'

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer. 
  
i. Difference 1: The open businesses have much more number of reviews than The closed businesses.
          
ii. Difference 2: They have different between the number of city.


SQL code used for analysis: 

SELECT    
count(city)
,SUM(review_count)
,is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open 

+-------------+-------------------+---------+
| count(city) | SUM(review_count) | is_open |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis. 
 
Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following: 
  
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: 

Predicting the review count from checkin count for business          
          
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data: 

Analyze the number of checkin to predict the number of review for businesses. Because of today people using social network all the time with many things e.g. making the decision choosing appropriate restaurant by 2 factor number of checkin and review and can be more factor such as star rating. There're some benefit to precise star rating when number of review growth.
                            
                   
iii. Output of your finished dataset: 
+--------------+--------------+-------+
